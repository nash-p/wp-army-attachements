All rights, ownership, and credits belong to the original mod author WhiskeyPotato

Changes:
    - Updated to 3.10.*
    - Attachments are now available for the General subclass only, not all commanders
        Sadly this requires Paragons DLC for the subclasses, will try to find a non-DLC implementation
    - Attachments are tiered to be in line with their effects

There are other changes not listed here, 
all in all I have tried to keep things in line with the original author's 'ethos'.
