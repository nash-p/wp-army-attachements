# Changes:
    - Updated to 3.10.*
    - Attachments are now available for the General subclass (if Paragons enabled) or after level 3 (Paragons disabled)
    - Attachments are tiered to be in line with their effects
    - Added a "dynamic" trait that grants a general bonuses/debuffs depending on his armies' habitability

There are other changes not listed here, 
all in all I have tried to keep things in line with the original author's 'ethos'.
