Changes:
    - Updated to 3.10.*
    - Attachments are now available for the General subclass only (Paragons enabled), or after level 3 (Paragons disabled)
    - Attachments are tiered to be in line with their effects

There are other changes not listed here, 
all in all I have tried to keep things in line with the original author's 'ethos'.

# [RESTYLED CHANGES]
My intention here is to streamline a few traits in this mod. Rather than having each attachement stand alone equally they will now be upgrades of each other, like vanilla traits.
Summary of intended changes:
    - Attachements will now become like support companies
    - Each general should have something like max 5 support companies, one from each 'type'
    - Some support companies will be upgrades of others going up tiers, e.g, Combat Software 1.0 and 2.0
    - All of this should be possible with inline scripts
    - Some lore/description editing to be more... in tune

Changelog:
    - Infrastructure changed to Defenses, reworked all traits here
    - Reinforcements changed to special forces group of traits, 1 for each ascension (except Synths) with 3 tiers each
