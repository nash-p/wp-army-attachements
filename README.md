Changes:
    - Updated to 3.10.*
    - Attachments are now available for the General subclass only, not all commanders
        Sadly this requires Paragons DLC for the subclasses, will try to find a non-DLC implementation
    - Attachments are tiered to be in line with their effects

There are other changes not listed here, 
all in all I have tried to keep things in line with the original author's 'ethos'.

[RESTYLED]
My intention here is to streamline a few traits in this mod. Rather than having each attachement stand alone equally they will now lead into each other, like vanilla traits.
Summary of intended changes:
    - Attachements will now become support companies
    - Each general should have something like max 5 support companies, one from each 'type'
    - Some support companies will be upgrades of others going up tiers, e.g, Combat Software 1.0 and 2.0
    - All of this should be possible with inline scripts
    - Some lore/description editing to be more... in tune
